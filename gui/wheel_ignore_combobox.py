    QComboBox subclass that ignores mouse wheel events.

    This prevents accidental value changes when the user scrolls through
    a form or window. The combo box will only change values when explicitly
    clicked and an item is selected.

    Usage:
        combo = WheelIgnoreComboBox()
        combo.addItems(["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"])

    Benefits:
    - Prevents accidental filter changes in reports
    - Prevents accidental rule condition changes
    - Better UX in dense forms with many combo boxes
    - User must explicitly click to change value
