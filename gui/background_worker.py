"""Base class for background workers with proper lifecycle management.

This module provides a reusable base class for background I/O operations
that implements the CORRECT cleanup pattern learned from commit #216 failures.

Key Features:
    - Proper QThread lifecycle management
    - Signal disconnection before cleanup
    - Timeout handling for wait()
    - Cancellation support
    - Generic data passing via signals

Critical Pattern (prevents crashes from commit #216):
    1. Check for existing worker before creating new one
    2. Disconnect ALL signals before cleanup
    3. quit() + wait(timeout) + deleteLater() sequence
    4. Handle timeout gracefully (terminate if needed)
